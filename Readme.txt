This is the beginnings of a longer project, to try and build a real world
variant of Richard Garfield's Robo Rally game.

it's still in a very early stage. 

At the moment it's just a server (and client) to push a raspberry pi with an
LED arrary. The one I'm using is the Unicorn HAT from Pimoroni 
(https:://shop.pimoroni.com) from the UK.

A robotics platform has yet to be selected for the main part of this work.
